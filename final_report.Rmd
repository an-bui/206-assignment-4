#### Introduction

  The California spiny lobster, *Panulirus interruptus*, ranges from Monterey Bay, California, to the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula in temperate-subtropical waters (Lindberg 1955, Vega Velázquez 2003). As adults, they inhabit rocky reef, intertidal, and kelp forest habitats, emerging from shelters at night to forage primarily on benthic invertebrates including mussels (Robles et al. 1990) and red and purple urchins (Tegner & Levin 1983). Within southern California nearshore ecosystems, lobsters can have important impacts as keystone predators. They have been shown to increase biodiversity within rocky intertidal regions in Southern California by limiting the density and sizes of mussels (Robles 1987, Robles et al. 1990, Robles & Robb 1993, Robles 1997, Robles et al. 2001). They may also indirectly facilitate the resistance of giant kelp forests from phase shifts to urchin barrens by consuming red and purple urchins (Tegner & Levin 1983, Halpern et al. 2006, Eurich et al. 2014).  
  
  Beyond their ecological importance, the CA spiny lobster supports a valuable commercial fishery extending from Point Conception to the US-Mexico border, generating over $18 million in ex-vessel landings annually (CDFW 2016). An avid recreational fishery also exists, extending further north to San Luis Obispo County and contributes an estimated 40 million in consumer spending to the state's economy each year (CDFW 2016). Restrictions on commercial and recreational takes include (1) a minimum carapace length (CL) limit (82.6 mm), which allows most individuals to reproduce for up to two years before reaching the legal size limit and (2) a seasonal fishery closure (March - Ocotober), which protects individuals from harvest during the species' spawning period. These management measures have helped to promote a stable lobster stock since 2000 (Neilson 2011), though an increase in commercial fishing effort raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the fishery.
  
  In order to maintain healhty lobster populations in the Santa Barbara Channel, as well as the kelp forest communities that they support, studies have recommended the establishment of no-take marine reserves to supplement traditional fisheries management practices (Airame et al. 2003). The establishment of such protected sites in 2012 has provided the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Reserach Project a unique opportunity to monitor lobster populations under different protection regimes and investigate the effects of fishing on kelp forest community dynamics (Reed 2017). Data collected by the SBC LTER can be used by researchers and policy makers to assess both the impacts of fishing efforts on coastal kelp forest communitites, as well as the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) in promoting healthy lobster populations. Studies have shown that only larger lobsters (> 90 mm) are capable of consuming adult urchins (Tegner & Dayton 1981, Tegner & Levin 1983, Stier et al. unpublished data). Because areas with predominantly adult urchin assemblages are more prone to becoming urchin barrens (Mann 1977, Brietburg 1996), the protection of lobsters above the legal size limit may be imperative in sustaining the health of giant kelp. As such, it is important that researchers and govenrment agencies are knowledgeable of the size structure and abundance of these important predators within coastal kelp forest habitats if they are to effectively manage their populations, habitat, and fisheries.

#### Methods and objectives
##### Marine Protected Areas in the SBC LTER
  California's Marine Life Protection Act was passed in 1999 to designate a network of marine protected areas with the input of scientists and citizen stakeholders. An express purpose of the act was to practice "adaptive management", or management of ecosystems and their communities by integrating current science to continually change management strategies to best fit the needs of the system as well as the stakeholders (cite MLPA).  
  Of the five focal sites within the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) sites, two were designated MPAs (Isla Vista, Naples Reef) in 2012, and three (Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, Mohawk) are open to both commercial and recreational fishing. This design acts as a natural experiment to understand the effects of fishing pressure on the population dynamics of integral species to the kelp forest, such as the CA spiny lobster. When integrating lobster surveys with algal and invertebrate surveys also being conducted at these sites, the SBC LTER is able to better construct a holistic profile of kelp forest community dynamics in response to fishing pressure.

##### Long term survey data and analysis
  Lobster surveys began in 2012 and are conducted annually in late summer as part of a long-term monitoring effort within Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) sites. Lobster counts and sizes are recorded by divers on SCUBA across four 60 x 5m transects approximately 1km offshore at five sites in the SBC LTER (Fig. 1).  
  Fishing pressure is quantified by counting floating trap buoys at eight SBC LTER sites every two weeks during the legal lobster fishing season from October to March. Trap buoys are attached to wire lobster traps set no deeper than 15m below the ocean surface.
  All data were analyzed using R version 3.5.1. Data on lobster count, measurements, and trap count for each focal site were compiled to compare mean abundance, length, and trap number for data between 2012 and 2017. Comparisons between 2012 and 2017 at each site were performed using two-sample Student's t-test ($\alpha$ = 0.05). Comparisons between sites were performed using one-way ANOVA ($\alpha$ = 0.05). 

##### Objectives
The following report analyzes lobster abundances and sizes at five SBC LTER locations, two of which are MPAs (Isla Vista, Naples Reef), and three non-MPAs (Arroyo Quemado, Carpenteria, Mohawk). We use monitoring data at these five sites to ask:
    1. how lobster abundance, size, and fishing pressure has changed over time between the start of surveys in 2012 and the most recent surveys in 2017,  
    2. how lobster mean size compares across all five sites in 2017, and  
    3. what proportion of lobsters are over the legal size minimum of 82.6mm for the commercial fishery in 2017.

# net increase of lobster abundance
##############################


```

  Lobster abundance has generally increased between 2012 and 2017, though sites differ in net increases in abundance. The Isla Vista lobster population responde quickly to the establishment of the MPA with a net increase of 580 lobsters (Figure abund_traps_plot. Conversely, the Naples Reef population experienced a smaller net increase of 106 lobsters over this five year period. This may be due to site location, as Naples is farther offshore and may have different patterns of lobster recruitment and immigration rates.
  At non-MPA sites, Arroyo Quemado saw a net increase of 29 lobsters, Mohawk Reef populations increased by 95 lobsters, and the largest increase was at Carpinteria with 627 lobsters. 
 As expected at non-MPA sites, when fishing pressure decreases, lobster abundance increases. At all three non-MPA sites, decreases in fishing pressure are generally followed by increases in lobster abundance. Fishing pressure has fluctuated greatly at all three sites but shows a net decrease between 2012 and 2017. While the effects on the lobster abundance can be slight (e.g. Arroyo Quemado) or large (Carpinteria), lobster populations are responding to fluctuations in fishing pressure.

  To evaluate the effects of fishing pressure on lobster populations, we compared lobster size (CL) at MPA and non-MPA sites between the time of MPA establishment (2012) and the most recent survey assessment (2017). Between years, mean lobster size did not differ signficantly at either of the two MPA sites: Isla Vista (t(`r round(ivee_t$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(ivee_t$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(ivee_t$p.value, 2)`) or Naples Reef (t(`r round(napl_t$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(napl_t$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(napl_t$p.value, 2)`). Despite non-significant changes, however, mean lobster CL did increase `change_ivee` mm and `change_napl` mm between 2012 and 2017 at Isla Vista (Cohen's *d* = `r round(ivee_d$estimate, 2)` and Naples Reef (Cohen's *d* = `r round(napl_d$estimate, 2)`, respectively (Fig.4). Conversely, two out of three non-MPA sites saw a decrease in mean lobster CL between years. Carpenteria, though non-significant (t(`r round(carp_t$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(carp_t$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(carp_t$p.value, 2)`) had a decrease of `change_carp` mm (Cohen's *d* = `r round(carp_d$estimate, 2)`). The most striking difference in lobster size was observed at Mohawk Reef, which saw a significant decline in mean CL (t(`r round(mohk_t$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(mohk_t$statistic, 2`, p = `r round(mohk_t$p.value, 2)`) of `change_mohk` (Cohen's *d* = `r round(mohk_d$estimate, 2)`) between 2012 and 2017. 
  
   The concurrent steady decrease in trap numbers at Mohawk Reef through time (Fig. 2) may suggest a case of diminishing returns for the commercial fishery. The decrease in average lobster size (Fig. 4) may be the result of higher fishing pressure in prior years (see Fig. 2, Mohawk Reef, 2012) in conjunction with the large recreational fishery presence on this easily shore-accessible reef. Because large lobsters may be capable of consuming urchins (Tegner & Levin 1983, Eurich et al. 2014) and indirectly facilitating the persistence of giant kelp, we recommend further site-wide assessments of kelp and consumer abundances to monitor the health of Mohawk Reef.
   
   The increasing average CL trend observed at Isla Vista and Naples Reef is encouraging given the relatively new (< 5 years) protections established at these two MPA sites. Slow growing taxa, such as lobsters (Engle 1979) which must molt to increase their body size (typically 1-2 times per year), are often slower to exhibit significant responses to protection (Lester et al. 2009). However, their small home ranges and high site fidelity to rocky reef habitats have contributed to their recoveries in other MPAs (Kay et al. 2012). CLOSING REMARKS HERE.
   
  
   large lobster produce more eggs--but there is evidence that most recruits actually come from baja so i'm not actually sure i'd hang my hat on this one...
   
 fig 1 increase in fishing pressur at aq and carp after 2012 may be due to est of mpas (shift of pressure elsewhere)

    In 2017, all sites have significantly different mean lobster carapace length (one-way ANOVA, F(4) = 3.42, _p_ < 0.01, $\alpha$ = 0.05) but pairwise comparison with post-hoc Tukey's HSD shows that only mean lobster carapace length at Naples Reef and Isla Vista and Naples Reef and Carpinteria are significantly different (Figure size_2017_boxplot, $\alpha$ = 0.05). 
  25% of lobsters at all three non-MPA sites are at or above the legal size limit of 82.6mm (Table lob_prop). However, at Naples Reef, 33% of lobsters are above the legal size limit. This indicates [something about MPAs working? idk Naples Reef lob size didn't change significantly between 2012 and 2017 so maybe the point could be something like "some places just have bigger lobs and we need to figure out what it is about that place that makes it such a good refugia for lobsters"]
  The low proportion of legal size lobsters in non-MPA sites may be because lobster surveys are conducted after the fishing season and most legal size lobsters have been taken from the system. In order to understand how fishing pressure impacts large, reproductively active individuals, we recommend adding surveys before the fishing season.

#### Conclusion and recommendations
  Using a long-term data set on lobster populations in the SBC LTER, we are able to how these populations change over time and are affected by location and MPA designation. We find that: 
  1. decreased fishing pressure generally leads to increases in lobster abundance 
  2. changes in mean lobster size over time differ by site
  3. the majority of lobsters surveyed are below the legal limit of 82.6mm.
Based on the findings of this report, we recommend:
  1. site-wide assessments to monitor kelp forest dynamics of Mohawk Reef, and  
  2. additional surveys of lobster populations in non-MPAs before the fishing season.
In conjunction with reports on other integral species in the kelp forest from the SBC LTER (e.g. urchins _Strongylocentrotus_ spp.), this report has the potential to inform furture research directions of the SBC LTER and also provide much needed population level data to policy makers and citizen stakeholders.
