```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##### Data viz:  
1. box and whisker for abundance and fishing pressure? or jitter?  
2. table of mean lobster sizes  
3. At Isla Vista and Naples Reef, the two protected MPA sites (with zero fishing pressure), how do lobster sizes
in 2012 and 2017 compare? At the non-MPA sites? -> t-test of some kind, 
4. What proportion of observed lobsters at each site are above the legal minimum? Does that proportion differ significantly across the 5 sites? -> chi square

```{r set up, include = FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(vcdExtra)

# read in .csv
abund <- read_csv("lobster_size_abundance.csv") %>% 
  expand.dft(freq = "COUNT")
test <- read_csv("lobster_size_abundance.csv")
traps <- read_csv("lobster_traps.csv")

# get in tidy format
abundance <- expand.dft(test, freq = "COUNT")
```
