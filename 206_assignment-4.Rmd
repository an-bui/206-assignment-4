```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

```{r set up libraries and data, include = FALSE}
# load packages

# read in .csv and get in tidy format
abund_master <- read_csv("lobster_size_abundance.csv")
abund <- as.data.frame(abund_master) %>%

traps_master <- read_csv("lobster_traps.csv")

```

#### Ideas:  
1. box and whisker for abundance and fishing pressure (because sample size is so big that median is probably a better indicator of central value than mean)? or jitter?  
2. table of mean lobster sizes (or box and whisker? code below)
3. At Isla Vista and Naples Reef, the two protected MPA sites (with zero fishing pressure), how do lobster sizes
in 2012 and 2017 compare? At the non-MPA sites? -> t-test for IVEE and NAPL, ANOVA for AQUE, MOHK, CARP
4. What proportion of observed lobsters at each site are above the legal minimum? Does that proportion differ significantly across the 5 sites? -> chi square

##### 0. exploratory things
```{r summary table, include = FALSE}
abund_table <- abund %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_size = round(mean(SIZE), 2),
    median_size = round(median(SIZE), 2),
    count = length(SIZE)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(site_full = case_when(
      SITE == "AQUE" ~ "Arroyo Quemado",
      SITE == "CARP" ~ "Carpinteria",
      SITE == "IVEE" ~ "Isla Vista",
      SITE == "MOHK" ~ "Mohawk Reef",
      SITE == "NAPL" ~ "Naples Reef"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(site_full, mean_size, median_size, count)

abund_table_columns = c("Site", "Mean size", "Median size", "Sample size")

kable(abund_table,
      col.names = abund_table_columns)

trap_table <- traps %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  filter(SITE == "AQUE" | SITE == "MOHK" | SITE == "CARP") %>% 
  summarize(
    count = length(SITE)
  )

```

##### 1. code for random shit
```{r abundance histogram, include = FALSE}
# just wanted to see what this looked like
abund_hist <- ggplot(abund, aes(x = SIZE)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ SITE)

abund_hist
```

```{r box and whisker of size by site, include = FALSE}
abund_size_box <- ggplot(abund, aes(x = SITE, y = SIZE)) +
  geom_boxplot()

abund_size_box
```

```{r box and whisker of abundance by site, include = FALSE}
abund_master_clean <- abund_master %>% 
  filter(SIZE != "-99999")
# because ?

abund_count_box <- ggplot(abund_master_clean, aes(x = SITE, y = COUNT)) +
  geom_boxplot()

abund_count_box
# ok so probably not a box and whisker 
```

```{r jitter of abundance by site, include = FALSE}
abund_count_jitter <- ggplot(abund_master_clean, aes(x = YEAR, y = COUNT)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_wrap(~ SITE)

##### 2. stats n shit: IVEE and NAPL
```{r summary stats, include = FALSE}

# HA: means are significantly different in 2012 and 2017 for IVEE/NAPL.

# 1. establish normality: is 2012 IVEE/2017 IVEE and 2012 NAPL/2017 NAPL data normal?
# 2. test for equal variances
# 3. run a t-test
